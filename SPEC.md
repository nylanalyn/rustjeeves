# rustjeeves — Specification

`rustjeeves` (binary: `jeeves`) is an IRCv3 bot framework written in Rust. It is an exploratory
rewrite of an existing Python bot — the goal is a small but real, extensible framework rather than
feature parity.

## Goals (this iteration)

The bot must:

1. **Connect to an IRC server**, with optional TLS.
2. **Authenticate to services (NickServ)** via **SASL** (PLAIN), with a fallback to messaging
   NickServ directly.
3. **Join configured channels** and **stay running**.
4. Run in one of two modes:
   - **Interactive** — opens a TUI (settings + logs).
   - **Non-interactive / headless** — no TUI; logs to stdout/file.
5. Be **modular**: WASM plugins dropped into a `modules/` folder are auto-loaded at startup.
6. Persist configuration and per-module state in **SQLite**.

"Done, for a start" = it connects, authenticates, joins rooms, and sits running, in both modes,
with a working settings UI, a filterable log view, the WASM module loader, and an `admin` module.

## Non-goals (deferred — see bottom)

Deep IRCv3 spec coverage beyond CAP + SASL + message tags and a full operator-facing module
marketplace/signature system.

## Runtime modes

| Mode | Flag | Behaviour |
|------|------|-----------|
| Interactive | `--interactive` (default) | Launches the ratatui TUI. |
| Headless | `--headless` | No TUI; connects and runs, logging to stdout + DB. |

## IRCv3 scope

Implemented now (via the `irc` crate): connection + optional TLS, `CAP LS/REQ/END` negotiation,
**SASL PLAIN**, and surfacing of message tags on events. NickServ-message authentication is
available as a fallback when SASL is not configured.

Deferred IRCv3 work: `batch`, `labeled-response`, `account-tag`, `away-notify`, `chghost`,
`server-time` semantics, multi-prefix handling, and `echo-message`.

## TUI (interactive mode)

Built with **ratatui** + **crossterm**.

- **Servers screen** — list of network profiles; add / edit / delete / enable-disable.
- **Edit server** — per-profile fields: label, enabled, host/port, TLS + "accept invalid TLS cert"
  (testing only; off by default), nick/user/realname, SASL account/password, NickServ password,
  channels, and user modes (e.g. `+B` bot flag, applied to ourselves on connect). Saved directly
  to SQLite; `Ctrl-R` applies (reconnects all enabled networks).
- **Admins screen** (per selected server) — list/add/edit/delete admin entries `(nick, role,
  optional account)`; shows the bound hostmask/account.
- **Logs screen** — scrollable log view, **filterable by category**: `ERROR`, `DEBUG`, `MESSAGE`,
  and `COMMAND`. Log lines are prefixed with the originating network label.
- **Integrations screen** — masked global API credential editing. Tavily and DeepL changes apply
  on the next request without reconnecting.

## Storage (SQLite via `rusqlite`)

A single `bot.db`, accessed through a DB actor task (rusqlite is synchronous; the actor keeps it
off the async tasks). Schema:

```sql
config(key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT);
servers(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, label TEXT UNIQUE, enabled INTEGER,
        host TEXT, port INTEGER, tls INTEGER,
        nick TEXT, username TEXT, realname TEXT, accept_invalid_certs INTEGER, umodes TEXT);
sasl(server_id INTEGER, mechanism TEXT, account TEXT, password TEXT, nick_password TEXT);
channels(server_id INTEGER, name TEXT, key TEXT);
admins(server_id INTEGER, nick TEXT, role TEXT, account TEXT,
       bound_hostmask TEXT, bound_account TEXT, PRIMARY KEY(server_id, nick));
profiles(id TEXT UNIQUE, server TEXT, nick TEXT, created INTEGER, last_seen INTEGER, title TEXT,
         birthday TEXT, pronoun_subject/object/possessive TEXT,
         location_display TEXT, location_label TEXT, lat REAL, lon REAL,
         PRIMARY KEY(server, nick));
module_kv(module TEXT, key TEXT, value TEXT, PRIMARY KEY(module, key));
logs(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, ts INTEGER, level TEXT, category TEXT,
     source TEXT, message TEXT);
profile_aliases(server TEXT, nick TEXT, profile_id TEXT, last_seen INTEGER);
profile_accounts(server TEXT, account TEXT, profile_id TEXT);
```

The bot connects to **all `enabled` server profiles simultaneously** (one IRC actor per network).
Events are tagged with the originating server `label`; module host functions take a `server` label
to target a specific network. Each actor is supervised and reconnects with exponential backoff.

Profiles receive a stable per-network UUID. Nicknames and services accounts are aliases of that
UUID, so `NICK` changes preserve profile and module identity. Existing nick-keyed rows are migrated
in place on startup.

## Permissions (per network)

Each network has an `admins` list of `(nick, role)` where `role` is `admin` or `super-admin`
(super-admin implies admin). The **host** resolves the sender's role for every message and stamps it
onto the event; modules enforce by checking `msg.role` (the bundled admin module gates `!shutdown`
to super-admin and `!reload`/`!refresh` to admin).

Identity is verified by, in order: an operator-pinned services account (matched against the IRCv3
`account-tag`); else a previously-bound account; else a previously-bound `nick!user@host` hostmask;
else — on first contact — the strongest identity available is bound ("introduction" /
trust-on-first-use), preferring the services account over the hostmask. The bot negotiates the
`account-tag` capability so verified accounts are available.

`module_kv` is the namespaced store modules persist into via the `kv_get`/`kv_set` host functions
— this is how modules "add their own info to the database".

## Module system (WASM via extism)

Any `*.wasm` file in the `modules/` directory (relative to the bot's working directory) is loaded
automatically at startup. Modules are sandboxed WASM plugins run via the **extism** host SDK; they
may be written in any language with an extism PDK (Rust is used for the bundled `admin` module).
Each module has a bounded worker thread and a 20-second guest execution deadline. Host functions
enforce the operator-owned policy in `module-capabilities.toml`; unknown modules receive only
`log`, `theme`, and `now`.

### Guest exports (a module implements any subset)

- `init` — called once at load; the module may register metadata/commands.
- `on_message` — channel/PM `PRIVMSG` events (JSON payload).
- `on_event` — connection/join/part/numeric events (JSON payload).

### Host functions — the "base" capability API (available to all modules)

There is no separate `base.wasm`; the common operations are the host-function surface:

- `send_message(server, target, text)`, `send_notice(server, target, text)`
- `join(server, channel)`, `part(server, channel)`
- `kv_get(key) -> value`, `kv_set(key, value)` (namespaced by the calling module's name)
- `log(level, category, message)`
- `now() -> unix_seconds` — current time (WASM modules have no system clock)
- `theme(key, default, vars) -> string` — fetch a user-configurable string (see Themes)
- `profile_ensure(server, nick)`, `profile_get(server, nick) -> Profile`,
  `profile_set(ProfileUpdate)`, `profile_clear(server, nick, field)` — shared, host-level user
  profiles any module can read/write
- `geocode(query) -> GeoResult` — keyless Open-Meteo geocoding (lat/lon + canonical label)
- `weather(lat, lon) -> WeatherResult` — keyless Open-Meteo current conditions
- `web_search(query) -> SearchResponse` — Tavily ranked web results; the API key remains in the
  host process and is read from the global SQLite setting, then
  `RUSTJEEVES_TAVILY_API_KEY`/`TAVILY_API_KEY` as fallback
- `translate(text, target_lang, source_lang?) -> TranslateResponse` — DeepL text translation;
  Free (`:fx`) and standard keys select the correct endpoint automatically, and the key remains in
  the host process
- **privileged:** `bot_reload()`, `bot_refresh()`, `bot_shutdown()`

Events are delivered as an `EventEnvelope { server, event }`; message events carry the sender's
resolved `role` (see Permissions) plus `nick`, `user`, `host`, `target`, `text`, and IRCv3 tags.

Payloads cross the host/guest boundary as JSON (serde types defined in the `jeeves-abi` crate).

### Utility modules

`search.wasm` provides `!g`, `!google`, and `!search`. It returns the first ranked Tavily result,
enforces a per-user cooldown, and falls back to a normal search URL when Tavily is unconfigured or
unavailable. The plugin receives neither unrestricted HTTP access nor the API key.

The interactive TUI exposes global API credentials under **Integrations (F3)**. Secret fields are
masked while editing and stored in SQLite's `config` table; the database itself is not encrypted.
Saving or clearing a Tavily or DeepL key takes effect on the next request without a reconnect or
module reload.

`history.wasm` provides channel-local `!seen <nick>` and quotes. `!quote <nick>` saves that user's
latest non-command line, `!quote "text"` saves a self-attributed quote, `!quote` selects a random
quote, and `!quote #N` retrieves one. Private messages are never recorded or exposed. Quote
deletion is limited to the quoted person, submitter, or an admin.

`memos.wasm` provides channel-local `!tell <nick> <message>`. The memo is delivered when that user
next speaks in the same channel, using stable profile identity where available so nick changes do
not lose messages. `!memos` reports a user's waiting count without exposing the text, and
`!memos clear` discards their waiting messages. Memos expire after 30 days and private-message
commands cannot create or reveal channel memos.

`translate.wasm` provides `!tr` and `!translate`. `!tr fr Hello` auto-detects the source language;
`!tr de:en Guten Morgen` supplies it explicitly. It limits input and per-user request rate, maps
common language names to DeepL codes, themes every wrapper/error, and never receives the API key.

### Admin module

`admin.wasm` (built from `modules-src/admin`) registers bot commands and, on authorized
`PRIVMSG`s, parses commands such as `!reload`, `!refresh`, `!shutdown` and invokes the privileged
host functions. It emits `COMMAND`-category log lines so actions appear in the TUI logs screen.

## Themes (configurable personality)

All **user-facing** text the bot posts is configurable via a human-editable `theme.toml`
(CLI `--theme`, default `theme.toml`), so Jeeves' phrasing can be changed without code. One
`[section]` per module (the section is the module's name). A module never hardcodes a posted
string — it calls the `theme(key, default, vars)` host function, which:

- writes `default` to the file on first use (lazy registration; `toml_edit` preserves existing
  edits/comments),
- reads the current value — a string, or a **list** of which one is chosen at random,
- substitutes `{var}` placeholders (e.g. `{user}`),
- returns the rendered line.

Edits to `theme.toml` apply live (the file is reloaded when its mtime changes). The personality is
**global** across networks. Internal/debug text is intentionally not themable.

```toml
[admin]
denied = "I'm afraid I can't allow that, {user}."
pong   = ["Pong.", "At your service, {user}.", "Indeed."]
```

## Discord / admin HTTP API

An optional localhost HTTP admin API (enabled with `--admin-token`, or `RUSTJEEVES_ADMIN_TOKEN`;
bind via `--admin-bind`, default `127.0.0.1:9110`) lets an external Discord router
(`ircbot_core/discord_admin.py`) drive the bot. It implements that router's contract:

- `GET /health` → `{"ok":true}` (unauthenticated)
- `POST /v1/command` (Bearer auth) — body `{"command","args"}` → `{"messages":[...]}`
- `GET /v1/events?since=N` (Bearer auth) → `{"events":[{"id","message"}]}` — surfaces ERROR-level
  and COMMAND-category log events (disconnects, admin actions) for the router to post to Discord

Commands: `help`, `status`, `modules`, `reload`/`refresh`/`shutdown`, and
`say`/`join`/`part <server> <target/#chan> …` (the `<server>` may be omitted when only one network
is connected). Add the bot to the router's `bots:` list with its `url` + `token_env`.

## Architecture

tokio runtime with long-lived tasks wired by channels:

- **IRC actor** owns the `irc::Client`: streams server messages into `Event`s (→ log bus + module
  dispatch) and executes `Action`s (send/join/part/quit) received over an mpsc channel.
- **DB actor** owns the single rusqlite connection and serves requests over a channel.
- **Module host** loads `modules/*.wasm`, dispatches events to guest hooks, and wires host
  functions back to the Action channel and DB actor.
- **Log bus** is a broadcast of `LogEvent { ts, level, category, source, message }`; the TUI and a
  stdout/DB sink subscribe.

## Deferred / future work

- Deeper IRCv3 specs (see IRCv3 scope above).
- Hot-reload of an individual changed `.wasm` without a full folder rescan.
- Negotiated IRC casemapping and deeper IRCv3 coverage.
- Signed/trusted module distribution beyond the local capability policy.
- Durable scheduling and a constrained general-purpose outbound HTTP host capability.
